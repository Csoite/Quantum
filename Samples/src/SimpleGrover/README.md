# Grover Search Sample #

This sample implements Grover's search algorithm. Oracles implementing the database are explicitly constructed together with all steps of the algorithm.

## Running the Sample in Visual Studio ##

Open the `QsharpSamples.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.
